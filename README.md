# SegSim

Basic visual simulation of segregating agents based on a satisfaction threshold of opposing agents that surrounds them. 

Unsatisfied agents move to random locations, in a way the animations look more fluid this way since it spends less time searching for a space that would satisfy them. 

The second simulation updates piece by piece, the original updates the entire board.
